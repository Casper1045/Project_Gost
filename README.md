GOST Cryptographic Implementation
Introduction
This project is an implementation of the GOST symmetric encryption algorithm, a Soviet-era standard that was highly classified until the dissolution of the USSR. Designed on a Feistel network structure, the algorithm was developed to ensure secure, symmetric encryption, rivalling the DES encryption standard used by the United States.

Our implementation covers the encryption and decryption processes of GOST, utilizing ECB, CBC, and CTR operation modes, which can be selected during encryption. This Python-based project aims to demonstrate the practical application of cryptographic principles and the GOST algorithm's efficacy in securing data.

Features
Implementation of the GOST encryption algorithm.
Support for ECB, CBC, and CTR operation modes.
Python scripts for key generation, permutation, and Feistel functions.
Utilities script for file handling and bytearray operations.
Comprehensive unit tests for each component.
